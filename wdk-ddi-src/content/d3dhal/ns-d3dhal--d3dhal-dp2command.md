# D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structure



## -description
<p>One or more D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND structures are parsed from the command buffer by the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/6128ff7a-0d2c-48df-8b5e-cab33c5a74f5">D3dDrawPrimitives2</a> callback, which uses the information it receives to draw one or more primitives. Each structure specifies either a primitive to draw or a state change to process.</p>


## -syntax

````
typedef struct _D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND {
  BYTE  bCommand;
  BYTE  bReserved;
  union {
    WORD wPrimitiveCount;
    WORD wStateCount;
  };
} D3DHAL_DP2COMMAND, *LPD3DHAL_DP2COMMAND;
````


## -struct-fields
<dl>

### -field <b>bCommand</b>

<dd>
<p>Specifies a primitive to draw or a state change to process. This member can be one of the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff545678">D3DHAL_DP2OPERATION</a> enumerated values. </p>
</dd>

### -field <b>bReserved</b>

<dd>
<p>Reserved for system use and should be ignored by the driver.</p>
</dd>

### -field <b>wPrimitiveCount</b>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the number of primitives to process. This member is valid when <b>bCommand</b> is not either of D3DDP2OP_RENDERSTATE or D3DDP2OP_TEXTURESTAGESTATE.</p>
</dd>

### -field <b>wStateCount</b>

<dd>
<p>Specifies the number of state changes to process. This member is valid when <b>bCommand</b> is one of D3DDP2OP_RENDERSTATE or D3DDP2OP_TEXTURESTAGESTATE.</p>
</dd>
